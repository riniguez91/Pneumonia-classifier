# Pneumonia-classifier
A python project aimed to create a pneumonia classifier based on an automatic learning model CNN (Conventional Neural Network), which uses a bunch of images with normal and pneumonia cases so that when the model is trained the medic can use this as an aid to his decision concerning a patient.

Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

If you wish to run the notebook I would strongly recommend using a GPU accelerator when re-training the model, else it will take a considerable amount of time.
